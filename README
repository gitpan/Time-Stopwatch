  Time::Stopwatch -- version 0.03

The Time::Stopwatch module provides a convenient interface to timing
functions through tied scalars.  From the point of view of the user,
scalars tied to the module simply increase their value by one every
second.

Installing the Time::HiRes module lets Time::Stopwatch timers provide
sub-second accuracy.  This feature will be automatically enabled if
Time::HiRes is present.

To install, just do:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If Time::HiRes is not installed, some tests will be skipped.

Alternatively you may simply put Stopwatch.pm in a subdirectory Time
wherever you like to keep your perl modules.
